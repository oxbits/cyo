            <p>
                CYO is not really a library. It's more like a new language build with interactivity in mind.

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>If you're technical, getting started is simple. Just require the "CYO" module in your app and you'll have access to all the directives.</p>
<p>If the last sentence made your head hurt, just copy the follow boilerplate into an empty HTML file, and it will work out of the box.</p>
<pre><code class='markup'>&lt;doctype html&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.2.19/angular.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;body ng-app=&quot;cyo&quot;&gt; 
    &lt;story&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;CYO&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;/story&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;</code></pre>

    <h2>Markup</h2>
